# RecruitingAI Subscription Pricing Strategy

## Executive Summary

Based on competitive analysis of the AI recruiting/interview automation market, I recommend a **3-tier pricing model** that positions RecruitingAI as an affordable alternative to enterprise solutions like HireVue ($35,000+/year) and Paradox ($12,000+/year) while offering more value than basic tools.
